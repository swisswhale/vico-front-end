## Description
Visual Conversation is a full-stack MERN app where users explore real artwork from museum databases like The Met and Harvard Art Museums. They can view detailed information about each piece, including auction results, and save favorites to their own digital art collections. These collections can be shared with other users, who can leave comments and ratings. The app also highlights the most popular artworks on the platform. With secure login and full CRUD functionality, Visual Conversation makes discovering and sharing art a social experience.
