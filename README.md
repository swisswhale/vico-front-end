## Description
Visual Conversation is a full-stack MERN app where users explore real artwork from museum databases like The Met and Harvard Art Museums. They can view detailed information about each piece, including auction results, and save favorites to their own digital art collections. These collections can be shared with other users, who can leave comments and ratings. The app also highlights the most popular artworks on the platform. With secure login and full CRUD functionality, Visual Conversation makes discovering and sharing art a social experience.

## <a name="design"></a>Design
* When asked to build a full CRUD app using Reat + Vite for the frontend and Express and Node for the backend, my partner and I thought a art app would be perfect. In this app a user will be allowed to create an account. Once a user has an account they can sign in and view a dashboard. This dashboard will include a space for the user to create a post of their favorite artwork. Users will also have the ability to add the artwork to a collection. Users will be able to comment on, delete, and post about their favorite collections.


## <a name="nextsteps"></a>Project Next Steps
#### List of Future Features
* Allow each post to stay on the dashboard.
* Implement a delete post button.
* Allow users to message one another artwork outside of the dashboard.
* Set up a user inbox.
* Finsh setting up my api to generate the artwork data.
